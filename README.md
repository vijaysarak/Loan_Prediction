The loan prediction dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers, data scientists, and financial institutions who aim to develop accurate and efficient models for loan risk assessment and decision-making processes.
By leveraging this data, these stakeholders can improve their loan approval procedures, enhance risk management strategies, and ultimately foster responsible lending practices.

# Attribute Information
Train dataset: 614 rows and 13 columns 
test dataset: 367 rows and 12 columns

Target Variable : Loan_Status

# Results
 Among all the models decision tree has accuracy score 90% , precision 90% , recall 96% and xgboost has accuracy score 98% , precision 98% , recall 100%.
 Hence we will conclude that decision tree and xgboost model is best fitted to our data.
